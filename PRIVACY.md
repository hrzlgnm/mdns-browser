# Privacy Statement for mDNS-Browser

Effective Date: 2024-10-24

As the developer of mDNS-Browser, I am committed to respecting your privacy. This privacy statement outlines how the application handles user data. In short: I do not collect, store, or share any personal data. Please read this statement to understand how your information is managed. This Privacy Statement outlines how the application handles data and clarifies the role of the operating system’s WebView component. In brief: mDNS-Browser does not collect, store, or share any personal data, though the underlying WebView component may perform background connections.

1. Information We Collect

mDNS-Browser does not collect any personal or non-personal information. The application operates locally on your device, does not connect to external servers, and does not send or receive any data except during manual update requests.

2. User-Initiated Updates

The application includes a feature that allows you to manually trigger updates. When you choose to check for updates, the application securely connects to the update server to verify the availability of new versions. No personal data is transmitted, and only minimal technical information (such as the current app version) is used to determine compatibility with the new version.

3. Opening the GitHub Repository

The only external connection made by the application occurs when you request to visit the GitHub repository. Upon your request, the application will open your default web browser and direct it to the official GitHub page for the application.

The application does not load external web content on its own or track your activity after the GitHub page is opened. Once you leave the application and open the GitHub repository in your browser, any data collection or tracking will be governed by GitHub's privacy policy. Please review GitHub’s privacy policy to understand how your data is handled on their platform.

4. WebView and External Connections

mDNS-Browser does not load external web content or make any network connections on its own. However, the application utilizes the operating system's WebView component for rendering certain content. While the application does not trigger any external data loading, the WebView may independently perform connections.

These background activities are part of the underlying WebView framework and are outside the control of mDNS-Browser. I recommend reviewing your device's operating system and WebView privacy settings to understand what data, if any, may be collected by the system during such connections.

5. Security

Even though the application does not collect data, I prioritize security. The application is built to operate securely and locally, with user-triggered updates as the only instance where an external connection occurs. Any connections made by the WebView component as part of the operating system are handled according to your device's system policies and protections.

6. Changes to This Privacy Statement

Any updates to this Privacy Statement will be communicated through the application or the official website. The "Effective Date" at the top of this document will be updated accordingly to reflect any changes.
